# CSCGs-for-counterfactual-causal-reasoning


- `CSCGcolab_learning_CSCGs.ipynb` contains manipulations of the original code written by D. George et al. aiming to understand whether the model supports causal semantics and can be used for implementing the episodic memory theory developed by M. Werning.
- `CSCG for counterfactual causal reasoning through episodic memories.ipynb` contains the revisited CSCG code dedicated to the recreation of the specific counterfactual causal reasoning basic scenario showed in `counterfactual_causal_basic_scenario.png` and correctly recreated by the model, as shown in `CSCG_for_counterfactual_causal_basic`.
