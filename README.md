# CSCGs-for-causal-reasoning


- `CSCGcolab_learning_CSCGs.ipynb` contains the original CSCG code as written by D. George et al. with manipulations aiming to verify whether the model supports causal semantics and can be used for implementing the episodic memory theory developed by M. Werning, proposing that episodic memory plays a crucial role in causal reasoning through counterfactuals.
- `CSCG for counterfactual causal reasoning through episodic memories.ipynb` contains the revisited CSCG code dedicated to the recreation of the specific counterfactual causal reasoning basic setting, as showed in `CSCG_for_counterfactual_causal_basic_setting.png` and recreated by the model, as showed in `CSCG_for_counterfactual_causal_basic`.
